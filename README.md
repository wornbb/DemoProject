# DemoProject
##Objective
The object of this project is to build & publish a WebView Android App for demonstrating our skills of software development engineer. We probably will also provide access from browser which converts it to a website. 
A sample of static website is provided at https://wornbb.github.io/DemoProject/FrontEnd/
## Tech Stack
Note: The tech is decided based on their effectiveness of demonstrating our skills rather than their fitness or necessity for the functionality of the app. 
### Front-end: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React & Redux
### Back-end:
Django, MySQL, Pytorch
### DevOps:
Docker. 
We treat DevOps as a stretch goal. The objective is to restructure the app backend into a scalable microservice. We are sure to use Docker to set up the production environment but uncertain about if we proceed to complete the DevOps toolchain. 
##Content & Functionality
