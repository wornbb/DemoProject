# DemoProject
##Objective
The object of this project is to build & publish a WebView Android App for demonstrating our skills of software development engineer. We probably will also provide access from browser which converts it to a website. 
A sample of static website is provided at http://yishen.me. Please note that this website is still under active development.
## Tech Stack
Note: The tech is decided based on their effectiveness of demonstrating our skills rather than their fitness or necessity for the functionality of the app. 
### Front-end: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React & Redux
### Back-end:
Django, MySQL, Pytorch
### DevOps:
Docker. 
We treat DevOps as a stretch goal. The objective is to restructure the app backend into a scalable microservice. We are sure to use Docker to set up the production environment but uncertain about if we proceed to complete the DevOps toolchain. 
##Content & Functionality 
The app has 3 functionalities. 
### Registration
It allows users to sign up and log in to their account.

It allows the user to score by touching the car in an image. The user response will be validated against the result from a Fast R-CNN model implemented in Pytorch.
